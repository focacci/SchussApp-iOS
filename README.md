# SchussApp-iOS

The SchussApp is a mobile application designed for use by Schussmeisters Ski Club members.

The app's purpose is to allow Schussmeisters passholders to sign up for the club's weekly
bus without the need to call in. In the case that the line is busy, or the office is not open,
members will not be inhibited from signing up.
